                    </h3>
                    In most states, you must be registered to vote in order to vote from the hospital.   
                </li>

                    This process varies by state-to-state, ranging from: filling out an emergency ballot application, making a request in
                    writing, requesting electronically. Check your state page for the specific process.

                    </h3>
                    In some states, the ballot will be mailed to you. If you're lucky, you may designate someone to pick it up for you at
                    the polling place or election office, or the election office may send someone to the hospital to delivery the ballot.
                    Check your state page for the specific process.
                    <br>
                    If you need help obtaining a ballot, engage your family members or friends. Alternatively, request to speak to social
                    work or case management and mention Patient Voting. You can always email us at patientvoting@gmail.com and we can help
                    connect you to someone locally.

                    require a witness to co-sign your ballot.

                    </h3>
                    Most patients don't realize they have the right to vote. Ask them if they're interested in learning more. It's important
                    to respect their refusal, if they want to focus on their health only.

                        Identify the barriers
                    </h3>
                Think about which ones the patient will be able to accomplish on their own, or which steps may require
                friend/family/staff assistance. For example:
                
                Printed materials - most patients won't have the ability to print materials while in the hospital. Offer to print off
                ballot applications for them and provide pens as needed.
                
                Transportation - the patient will be unable to leave the hospital. Is there a friend or family member that will be able
                to pick up and deliver the ballot to the election office? Is there a staff member who can help fax the application to
                the election office? Some states have restrictions on who can help with which steps. Review the state-specific
                information.
                
                If you live in a state where the election office sends an employee to help the patient vote, will the employee know how
                to find the floor or bed where your patient is located?
                
                If you're stuck on your floor during your long shift, who else can help in the hospital? We recommend case management,
                social work, and hospital-based volunteers

                    which steps. Review the state-specific information.
                    
                    Request help from hospital staff. If your family member would like additional assistance with casting a ballot, request
                    help from case management or social work, or from your medical team.
